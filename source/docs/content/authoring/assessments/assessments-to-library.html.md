## Adding Questions to an Assessments Library

Once an assessment is added to an assessment library, it can be accessed later and added to a project or course with ease. Adding assessments to an assessment library has a few simple steps.

1. The first step is creating the assessment. Once all of the content is filled in, we can add it to an assessment library. Click the **"SAVE IN LIBRARY"** button on the bottom right of the window:

2. A window will appear with a dropdown menu of all the available libraries that the question can be added to. Choose the desired library from the dropdown menu.

3. Once the desired library has been chosen, press the blue **"SELECT"** button.

The assessment has now been added to the chosen library. More information about modifying the question in the library and disconnecting the question from the library can be found using these links:
